The Oneiron Interactive Map, for my D&D players.

## If you wanna use the code for your own map:
You can either put everything in your own repository or run it on a localhost, but simply put you **substitute the map image with your own**, **run the editor** page and add the markers you want. After that you **click on "Export markers"**. It will create that markers.json file that will be read by the index.html when it's in the same directory.

If you run the editor again within the same dir as everything else it will also import the markers so you can continue from when you left off, but **everytime you click on "Export Markers" it will create a new json**, so you'll have to substitute it. This is not optimal but I prefer it personally.

Knock yourself out!
